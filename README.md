Hack112 Project

## How to Run the Project:
In order to run the ML projections, download the repo and run the python code in the visualize.py file. The output will be a canvas with Vegas bets on the NFL matches of the current week as well as the Projections for each team in playing the match with their chances of winning.

## What it does:
The program runs an ML model on NFL games and projects the winner in each game of the current week of NFL games. The program further scrapes off the web the Vegas bets for the current week of games, and compares the Vegas bets against the ML projections. The data is displayed on a Tkinter canvas after it has been fetched.
